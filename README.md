# minus-twelve
this is my submission for the #minus-twelve tool-making ysws where we were supposed to use javascript/typescript for our projects.

## what it does
1. provides a simple interface to generate, manipulate, and visualize color palettes for frontend projects.
2. includes utilities for lightening, darkening, and creating accessible color contrasts.
3. works with css variables and integrates with popular frameworks like tailwindcss or plain css.

## features
1. generates complementary, analogous, or triadic palettes from a single input color.
2. checks contrast & validates color combinations against accessibility standards.
3. export palettes as css variables for easy integration with frontend projects.

## demo
you can find the live link to the npm package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/color-palette-helper) <br><br>
